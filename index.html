<p> My name is Jean Carlo Baltazar, I like soccer and learning about business since I plan to become a founder and CEO of my future company.Its my first year and I plan to make it more once I do better and work harder to get where I want to be. I am a freshman, and I'm always hungry for a new challenge and hope TXT gives me that.
